All files that have been changed by the AFD, can be viewed
with the help of this dialog (see <a href="log.html#production_log">Production
Log</a>). Since the production log can be very extensive, there are lots of
possibility to reduce the search time by filling in some of the following
values:
</p>
<center><img src="../images/show_plog_selection.gif" alt="[closeup of selection part]"></center>
<p>
<center>
<table border>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>1</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Enter the start and end time of the search. If no value is entered
       it will always take the earliest or latest entries it finds. There
       are two time forms. One is the absolute and the other is the
       relative time format. The following absolute forms are possible:
       MMDDhhmm, DDhhmm and hhmm (MM = month [01-12], DD = day [01-31],
       hh = hour [00 - 23], mm = minute [00 - 59]). The relative form
       always starts with a hyphen '-' and has the following format:
       -DDhhmm, -hhmm or -mm.</td>
   <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>2</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>When set the production log will be shown continuously, ie. if new
       entries come they will be shown live as they come in.</td>
   <td>&nbsp;</td>

   <td>&nbsp;<b>3</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Shows the current date and time in the following format:
       DD.MM.YYYY hh:mm</td>

   <td>Enter the original file name. The name may have any number of the two
       following wild cards: * and ?. If no file name or wild card is entered
       it will always search for all file names. Multiple file names/patterns
       can be entered by separating them with a pipe (|).</td>
   <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>5</b>&nbsp;</tD>
   <td>Here it is possible to enter the length/size of the original file. If
       a &lt;, &gt; or ! sign is put before the size value, it will search
       for files less then, greater then or not the given size.</td>
   <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>6</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Enter the new file name, the one that has been produced. The name may
       have any number of the two following wild cards: * and ?. If no file

<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>8</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>The source directory where the AFD has picked up the file. Even here
       it is possible to enter wild cards. Sometimes it can be easier if
       you just enter the directory ID. However this must have a leading
       &#35; for it to be detected as directory ID. One can also enter
       the directory alias with a leading @ sign. Multiple directory
       names and/or ID's can be entered by separating them with a comma (,).</td>
   <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>9</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Here you can enter a remote host name and only files that where
       send to this host will be shown. It is also possible to enter more
       then one host, by separating the hosts with a comma (,). Wild cards
       can also be used. When using the syntax &lt;user&gt;@&lt; hostname&gt;
       it is possible to narrow down the search to a specific user
       on that host.</td>
   <td>&nbsp;</td>

   <td>The command used to do the production. Again you can use the
       following wild cards: * and ?. It is possible to enter more

   <td>&nbsp;<b>11</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>The Job Identification Number to search for. This is a hexadecimal
       number which can be found at the end of each line in TRANSFER_LOG,
       RECEIVE_LOG and sometimes even SYSTEM_LOG when it starts with a
       &#35;. This number may also be entered with a leading &#35;. Multiple
       numbers can be entered by separating them with a comma (,).</td>

   <td>Select ratio how files are produced. 1 - 1 ratio example could
       be 'exec -d bzip2 %s', 'prefix del', 'rename', etc. This does not
       always mean there needs to be a new file name. If you convert a
       file the new name can be the same as the original name. 1 - 0 is when
       the original file name is deleted during the production process,
       either due to an error during the production process or as a
       result of it. 1 - n can be 'exec tar xf %s'. n - 1 is if you create
       a tar or any other archive. n - n is some exec option which creates
       from n files another arbitrary number of files. The default 'Any'
       is all the above.</td>

   <td>&nbsp;<b>13</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>The return code of the command executed. Normally a 0 is successful

       value, it will search for files that took less then, greater then or
       not the given value. Values are in seconds. It is possible to enter
       decimal values, lowest value is 0.001.</td>

</center>
</p>
<p>
It is not necessary to fill in any values, however then the search might
take a very long time for it to finish, depending on how long and how many
log files there are. While the dialog is searching for data, the function
of the search button changes into a stop button, enabling the user to
interrupt the search. This button and the slider of the list widget are the
only buttons that are active during a search. Thus, the user can search in
the list widget by using the slider, while the dialog is still searching.
Once a search is interrupted, the search will always start from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
Here follows a short description of the list widgets and the meaning of
each item:
</p>
<p>
<center><img src="../images/production_log_list.gif" alt="[closeup of the list field]"></center>
<p>
<center>
<table border>
<tr>
   <td>mm.dd.</td>
   <td>The date in the following format: MM.DD. where MM is the month
       (01-12) and DD is the day of the month (01-31).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>HH:MM:SS</td>
   <td>The time in the following format: hh:mm:ss where hh is the hour
       (00-23), mm is the minute (00-59) and ss is the second (00-59).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Orig File name</td>
   <td>The original file name as it was before the production.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Size</td>
   <td>The original file size as it was before the production.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>New File name</td>
   <td>The new file name as after the production.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Size</td>
   <td>The new file size after the production.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Ratio</td>
   <td>The ratio of input files to output files.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Exec cmd</td>
   <td>The command used to do the production.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>RC</td>
   <td>The decimal return code of the command executed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>P-time</td>
   <td>Production time. This is the wall-clock-time to do the production.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>C-time</td>
   <td>CPU time. This is the CPU user and system time to do the
       production.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>
<p>
When the file name is longer then it is shown in the list widget it is
still possible to view it by using the 'AFD info click'. This is done
by pressing the right mouse button while the cursor is over the wanted
item in the list widget. The following window will pop up:
</p>
<p>
<center><img src="../images/show_plog_info.png" alt="[picture of info dialog]"></center>
</p>
<p>
As shown, this window also shows what the entry in the DIR_CONFIG looked
like when this file was send. Thus it is always possible for the AFD
system administrator to see with what options the files are distributed,
regardless how many changes there where in the DIR_CONFIG file.
</p>
<p>
Right under the list widget is a summary line which looks as follows:
</p>
<p>
<center><img src="../images/production_log_summary.gif" alt="[summary line]"></center>
</p>
<p>
<center>
<table border>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>1</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>The time in days from the first entry found to the last entry in
       the list.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>2</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>The rest time in hours, minutes and seconds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>3</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>The total number of production entries found.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>4</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>The total size of the original files.</td>

   <td>&nbsp;<b>5</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>The total size of the new files.</td>

   <td>&nbsp;<b>6</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>The total wall-clock-time it took to produce all the files.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>7</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>The total CPU time (user + system) it took to produce all the
       files.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>
<p>
Under the summary line follows a status line showing the current status,
here how long it took for the search:
</p>
<p>
<center><img src="../images/show_xlog_status.png" alt="[closeup of the status line]"></center>
</p>
<p>
At the bottom is a line with up to six (depending on user permissions) buttons
which have the following meaning:
</p>
<p>
<center><img src="../images/show_plog_button_line.gif" alt="[closeup of the button line]"></center>
</p>
<p>
<center>
<table border>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>Search</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Pressing this button will start the search. During the search the
       name of the button will change to Stop. Pressing this will interrupt
       the search and the button will be renamed to Search again. Pressing
       search again will start the search from the beginning and not where
       it was when it was interrupted.</td>
   <td>&nbsp;</td>

   <td>&nbsp;<b>Select All</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Selects all elements in the list.</td>

   <td>This will popup another dialog which can be used to print what is shown
       to a separate file, send it in a mail to someone or print it to a
       printer. The Range field allows to specify what will be printed,
       either what has been selected or everything.</td>
